## :scroll: Description
The Weather App is an application created to participate in the #AndroidDevChallenge.
I tried following a minimalist style adding the most value as possible.
You can change the theme using the Backdrop.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The Weather App follows the Accessibility recommendations for Jetpack Compose and it's available in two languages:
- English
- Spanish

Data is randomly generated and returned from the repository using Flow.
The app handles three states: Loading/Error/Success. Each possible way has been tested.

Used libraries:
- Flow
- Hilt
- Mockk
- Joda-Time

Icon Set:
- Charlotte de Wolfe
